1. **Create a New VM on Proxmox for Docker**:
   - Set up a new VM in Proxmox specifically for Docker.
   - Install a lightweight Linux distribution like Ubuntu Server.
   - Allocate sufficient resources (CPU, RAM) considering the demands of the API and GPT model.

2. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**:
   - On the VM, install Docker and Docker Compose.
   - Docker Compose will help manage the application stack.

3. **Prepare the Docker Environment**:
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for your application.
   - Define services for the API, including any dependencies like databases or other tools.

4. **Setting Up the Intermediary API**:
   - Write the Python script for the API, incorporating OpenAI GPT models and GitHub API interactions.
   - Create a Dockerfile to containerize your Python script.
   - Ensure the Docker container has network access to GitHub and sufficient resources.

5. **Deploy and Run the Application**:
   - Use Docker Compose to build and run your application containers.
   - Test the API to ensure it's communicating correctly with both the custom GPT and GitHub.

6. **Security and Access**:
   - Configure your VM's firewall (UFW or iptables) for security.
   - Set up reverse proxy (like Nginx) if you want to expose the API externally, and use SSL for encryption.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Implement monitoring tools to keep track of the container's health and performance.
   - Regularly update your Docker images and host OS.

8. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Set up a backup solution for your Docker volumes and VM.

9. **Documentation**:
   - Keep detailed documentation of your setup, configurations, and changes for maintenance and troubleshooting.

Using Docker containers for deploying your API on a Proxmox VM provides a robust, flexible, and scalable environment, suitable for handling the demands of an intermediary API working with GPT and GitHub.
