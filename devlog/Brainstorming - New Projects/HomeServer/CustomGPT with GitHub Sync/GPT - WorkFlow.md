1. **User Interaction with Custom GPT**:
   - The user interacts with the custom GPT, providing details about the problem, such as an error log or specific issues with a component.
   - The GPT contextualizes the problem, identifying key elements like the component involved, error types, and possible file associations.

2. **Sending Request to the Intermediary API**:
   - The GPT sends a request to the intermediary API. This request includes the problem context and any specific instructions or queries.
   - The request could be structured in JSON, including details like error messages, component names, and user queries.

3. **Intermediary API Processing**:
   - The intermediary API receives the request and invokes a Python script powered by OpenAI's GPT models.
   - This script performs several functions:
     - **Problem Analysis**: Using GPT, it deeply analyzes the error log and context to understand the nature of the problem.
     - **GitHub API Interaction**: It calls the GitHub API endpoints to fetch relevant files. It knows which files to fetch based on the GPT's analysis (e.g., if the error is related to a database, it fetches database-related files).
     - **Code Analysis and Suggestions**: After fetching the code, the script analyzes it for potential issues, like structural problems or logical errors. It can also compare file structures against standard practices to identify naming or organizational issues.
     - **Optimized Response Creation**: The script then generates a response that includes insights into the problem, relevant code snippets, and suggestions for resolution.

4. **Response to Custom GPT**:
   - The intermediary API sends back a response to the custom GPT.
   - This response is concise, focusing only on relevant information and actionable suggestions.

5. **User Feedback Loop**:
   - The custom GPT presents this information to the user.
   - Based on user feedback, further requests may be sent to the intermediary API for additional analysis or different aspects of the problem.
